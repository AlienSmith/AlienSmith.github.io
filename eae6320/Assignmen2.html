<h4 style="text-align: left;">In this assignment, we learned how to separate specific abstraction from a large chunk of codes. There are generally two situations, The code could be totally platform-dependent, in which case we only need to separate the code into different classes for different platform. Or it could be partially platform-independent, in which case we should put the comment parts together in one class, and implement the definition of the platform-dependent parts in separate .CPP files.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">To seperated the second type of code, usually you will have a .h file which uses the preprocessors to provides different platform-dependent data members and contain all the interface(public functions). then use a .CPP file to give the definition of the common interface and have a platform-dependent interface defined in separated .cpp files, which is included only under the right platform.</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">My implementation is a bit different. Basically, I used a base class to contain the common interface and inherited classes for the difference. Having commen data in base class and plateform-dependent data in children. Using overwrite function in children class to make sure the right set of action got invoked on certain platforms. I would discuss more later.</h4>

<h3>Things remain different</h3>
<h4>Actually, there aren't many differences in comparing the remaining d3d11 code with OpenGL code other than they use a different syntax, except that d3d11 would use a "View" to represent the scene, while OpenGL would use "program", which has already been migrated to Effect codes.</h4></body></html>
