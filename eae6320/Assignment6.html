<p><strong>Here is A picture of human readable files, there are three advantages to have human readable files</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firstly, it would be more matianable By having these files, people do not need to run the code</strong></p>
<p><strong>to have some ideas of the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondly, the could would be more encapsulated. People could change the content of the game by modifying these files and </strong></p>
<p><strong>not Worrying The implementations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thirdly, these files would make debug easier. having all data organized togather,making finding them during debug easier. </strong></p>
<p><strong>There are three requirments of humanreable files, it should be easy to understand, easy to read, and easy to edit. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The following is a human readable files for defines triangle geoemtry. Adding vertexcount and indexcount makes the file more </strong></p>
<p><strong>easy to read for people, but more expensive to maintain. Cause lua could get the size of tables automatically.</strong></p>
<p><strong>and currenly we are hand writing these files, having two extra values means more to take care of when modifying the file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using comment is good way to solve this problem for now. It would make more sence to inlcude counts as parameters when we are </strong></p>
<p><strong>generating those files by programs</strong></p>

<h3>press space to see the triangle, Use arrow key to move the camera and use "Home" "Delete" "END" "PGDN" To move the object around</h3>
